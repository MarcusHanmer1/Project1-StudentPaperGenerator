## The Problem  
As a Maths student myself, my friends and I often experiance a lack of practice questions for our course, so why not make infinate questions made by an agent who's studied both the Maths notes and example questions?

## The Solution
Yichun is currently a streamlit based app able to 'read' information and example question to generate more for the user following the same style, but being completely new!
* **AI Agent:** An LLM based agent that generates infinite exam style questions on demand.

## Tech stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Low code)
* **AI backend:** Google API

## Documentation
* [PRD](docs/PRD.md) - *Detailed feature specs and success metrics.*
* [Ethics](docs/Ethics.md) - *Prevent Yichun from hallucinating math answers.*
